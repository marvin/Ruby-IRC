1.0.14 
	* Fixed a bug in the way the SSL socket was reading. This should make SSL useable. Yay
1.0.13
	* Updated to support Ruby 1.9.
1.0.12
	* Added SSL support with the :use_ssl => 1 flag. This is a VERY experimental features. And currently only works when the SSL Buffer gets full. This seems like a bug in the way that SSLSocket responds to Kernel.select(). It seems like readline and family work directly without the select so I might just remove the select call in the future.

	* Fixed a typo in IRCConnection that was causing remove_io_socket to fail
	
1.0.7 12/14/2006 cboyer
   * Added threading to event generation code, when the select loop generates and event it is now spun off and doesn't interrupt the select

   * Removed a lot of the 'puts' that are still going on.
